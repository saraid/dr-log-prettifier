Possible Features

Anonymizer

Strip out anything that the system thinks is a name
and replace with something generic. Can replace with
nonsense string or generic names. If something is
obviously not right (example: LOOK descriptions), may
decide to ignore the anonymizer completely and
permit an override.

Perspective Remover

Remove all significant instances of "you" and replace
with a provided name.

Highlighter

Flag certain strings, or string types, in a certain hex 
color.

Sanitizer

Remove any instances of the command prompt. Convert 
whisper commands into actual statements. Convert combat
strings into readable content.

Statistical Analyzer

How often did someone speak during the log? How many of
X hits did you get in with Y weapon? How many times did
you get hit? Flesch-Kincaid score of various people?
